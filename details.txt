1.The project was built for my former workplace in my internship. The goal of this project was to post complains regarding a company named "BD Travel" and for this the name of this project in "BD Travel Diaries".

2. Here anyone can post any complain without signup in the site. At first go to "http://localhost/BdtravelDiaries/articles.php".
3. After signin just by their anu user name they can post and make a flag of any existing post of others.
4. There is no facility to flag own post.
5.The flag notifications can be seen in admin side just after 3 secs interval. For that you will have to visit "http://localhost/BdtravelDiaries/admin.php" in same or different browser.



*** Configuration***

2.Create a database in phpmyadmin named "bdtravediaries";
3. Import the database from main folder named "bdtravediaries.sql";
4. Go to "http://localhost/BdtravelDiaries/articles.php";
5.Signin by any username;
6. You can find some posts there. You can post a new post and flag any existing post.
7. To see the impact of flagging a post go to "http://localhost/BdtravelDiaries/admin.php".
